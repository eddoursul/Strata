// include/strata/kernels/qsa_decode_attn.hpp - the QSA attention over each query's selected cells.
//
// The kernels read the KV POOLS directly through the page table and the selection ids (no gather copy) and serve
// all `n_head / n_head_kv` query heads that share a KV head from one read of each cell: a block per (KV head, query)
// walks the query's cells in tiles of 64 with an online softmax.  INT8 pools on the tensor cores: q and the
// probabilities as 24-bit fixed point (three 8-bit limbs) against the int8 codes, the integer sums exact, ~2.5e-6 of
// a head's largest output from FP64 on real prompts (FP32 kernels ~3e-6).  4-bit sides (kv_q4.hpp: --kv q4_0's K and
// V, k8v4's V) the same way, their codes made signed bytes: the queries of a rotated K are rotated and the output of a
// rotated V rotated back inside, so callers pass and get the model's vectors whatever the format.  FP16 pools in FP32.
//
// The prompt path's queries fill the GPU by their number.  A verify window's 1-4 queries would leave most of it idle,
// so the decode splits each query's cells among up to 20 blocks (whole tiles, all queries' blocks in one wave) whose
// partial sums a merge adds with the usual log-sum-exp rescale.  Grids are sized by the capacity; the real count comes
// from `step[kStepWidth]` as for every other capturable QSA kernel.
